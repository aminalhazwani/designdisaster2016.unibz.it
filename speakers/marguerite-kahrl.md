talktitle: "Con MOI"
talkabstract: "A project I am presently working on is Con MOI, an informal group of Italian and migrant citizens who practice real solidarity, strengthening social and human bonds through sharing food, time and mutual attention. We practice recovery and redistribution of surplus food that can no longer be sold, without any exchange of money. We are defining a new way of considering the community and turn to retailers, markets, medium and large retail facilities, restaurants, communities and individuals to collect food surpluses and redistribute the territory.
Con MOI evolved out of a collaboration between myself and Marjetica Potrč for PAV Parco Arte Vivente, in Torino, Italy. Our intention was to develop new resilient connections around the Experimental Centre for Contemporary Art and park with a process-oriented study of urban ecology that employed permaculture and deep ecology to reimagine the existing community, one which has experienced upheaval, isolation and depression. After carefully reviewing various ideas, difficulties, analyses, and problems connected with proposed locations, we selected Ex Moi as the site for our onsite project. Since then we have been on an adventure to build a prototype of democratic exchange with food sharing as the catalyst.
The buildings known as Ex Moi were constructed as part of Turin’s Olympic Village, which was abandoned after the 2006 Winter Olympics. In 2013, four of these buildings were occupied by refugees from North and Central Africa. The squat has since grown rapidly, from 750 occupants this summer to 1,050 currently. The squatter community is self-governed and has a number of pop-up shops, including a tailor, a barber, a grocery, a restaurant and a school run by volunteers. The people who live here, however, are excluded from social services, a situation that polarizes the opinions of neighbors and politicians alike.
Using a sustainable timeline as a tool, we are now formalizing the operational aspects of the Con Moi network. The end result should be food security for the refugees, visibility and political integration, a stronger sense of community, and new and more effective capabilities. But we face many obstacles and challenges, such as contending with the judgmental space of asking for food as an outsider. "

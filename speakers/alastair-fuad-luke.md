talktitle: "Dissonant design: positive disruptions, transitions and hope!"
talkabstract: "Design is in flux, as witnessed by a plethora of adjectives co-joined with design (co-/eco-/open/participatory/social/slow/transition/ transformation). To date, these niche modes of designing are having little impact on our dominant socio-technical landscapes and regimes as viewed from a Multi-Level Perspective. Can we adopt a more paralogical stance (after Jean François Lyotard)? Can we trigger system(ic) changes with a ‘dissonant design’ approach which fosters a healthy societal agonism and active-ism? What role might design f(r)ictions play? And, who are the ‘designers’ that might implement these positive disruptions, encourage transition and give hope?"
